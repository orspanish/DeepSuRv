Description: This is a deep-learning application of the Cox proportional 
    hazards model. It learns model covariates during the training process and 
    does not require them to be specified before the formation of the model, 
    like in traditional Cox regression. This package is meant to be used in 
    conjunction with the `survex` R package to produce counterfactuals for the 
    model outputs.
