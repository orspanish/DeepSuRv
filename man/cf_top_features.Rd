\title{Identify top influential features for an individual prediction}
\usage{
cf_top_features(expl, x_row, k = 3, eps = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{expl}{A Survex explainer object created by make_deepsurv_explainer().}

\item{x_row}{A one-row data frame representing a single individual.}

\item{k}{Integer; number of top features to return (default = 3).}

\item{eps}{Numeric; small relative change applied to each feature (default = 0.05).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the top influential features and their absolute risk changes.
}
\description{
Perturbs each feature slightly and measures the change in predicted risk.
Ranks features by their absolute effect on the output.
