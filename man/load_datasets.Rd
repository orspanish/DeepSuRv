}
\value{
A named list where each element corresponds to a dataset group,
and each group contains named arrays read from the HDF5 file.
}
\description{
Internal helper function that reads a DeepSurv-style HDF5 file containing
groups such as \code{"train"}, \code{"valid"}, and \code{"test"}. Each group
is expected to contain datasets such as \code{"x"}, \code{"t"}, and \code{"e"}.
}
\details{
Uses \code{hdf5r::H5File} to open the file in read-only mode. Reads each
dataset fully into memory using the \code{[]}-operator.
