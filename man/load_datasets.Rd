\title{Load Datasets from an HDF5 File}
\usage{
load_datasets(dataset_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset_file}{Character string specifying the path to the HDF5 file to be loaded.}
}
\value{
A named list of groups, where each group is itself a list of datasets.
}
\description{
This function reads datasets stored in an HDF5 file and returns them as a nested list.
It requires the \pkg{hdf5r} package for handling HDF5 file operations.
}
\details{
The HDF5 file is opened in read-only mode using the \pkg{hdf5r} package.
Each top-level group (e.g., \code{"train"}, \code{"valid"}, \code{"test"}) is read as a list of arrays.
Within each group, all datasets (e.g., \code{"x"}, \code{"t"}, \code{"e"}) are read into memory.

The function automatically closes the HDF5 file connection after reading all contents.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(hdf5r)
datasets <- load_datasets("data/survival_data.h5")
names(datasets)
str(datasets$train)
}
